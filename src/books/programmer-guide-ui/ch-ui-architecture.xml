	<title>Architecture</title>
	<para> DNet Extjs based user interface is structured on three main
		levels from bottom to top they are: data-controls, frames and
		application.</para>
	<para> The data-control is a generic reusable component, the basic
		building block of the application. It is an MVC group which defines
		the three types of elements for a business object: the model,
		predefined views and a controller. Aside from the basic functions like
		actions(CRUD operations control, action state management, record
		navigation, etc), the controller implements various logic which is
		data-control specific and should be available regardless of where and
		how this data-control is used.</para>
	<para> Frames are `mini-applications` built up from data-controls
		linked together by relations. A frame's view is a composite view which
		usually is created combining together the predefined views of the
		included data-controls arranged in frame specific layouts. It also
		implements specific functional logic. Aside of the data-controls it
		can include other base components like assignment windows or whatever
		free-hand construct is required.</para>
	<para> The application level is the top level layer, it is responsible
		to create the main viewport where the user-interface is rendered,
		provides session and menu management, frame navigation and routed
		frame communication, etc. It is provided mainly by DNet-Core,
		however, any bundle can provide contributions to override and
		customize its look and behavior.</para>
